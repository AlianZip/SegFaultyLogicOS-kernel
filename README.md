# SegFaultyLogicOS Kernel

Just a simple kernel for modular SegFaultyLogicOS from a programmer who can't write kernel :D

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Low-level Interaction Logic**
- [ ] **ELF Module Loader**
- [ ] **Module Manager**
- [ ] **Isolation Mechanisms**
- [ ] **Inter-Module Communication**
- [ ] **Kernel Services**

## Architecture Overview

SegFaultyLogicOS follows a strict microkernel architecture where the kernel provides only the most fundamental services:

- **Minimal Kernel Space**: The kernel itself contains only essential functionality
- **Module-Based Design**: All system services run as separate, isolated modules
- **Message Passing**: Clean communication interface between modules
- **Security First**: Built-in isolation and privilege separation from the ground up

## Development Status

*Early Development Phase* - Core architecture and foundational components are being implemented. This is an educational project I'm exploring operating system design principles.

## Technical Foundation

Built entirely in Rust. The kernel will provide a safe abstraction layer over hardware while maintaining performance and control.
